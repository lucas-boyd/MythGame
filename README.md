# MythGame

Created as a joint project for my computer science capstone project and mythology final.

A 2D puzzel platformer, that uses amnesia as a game mechanic to progress through the various levels.

Goals of this project are to complete a full 5 minute playable demo for the mythology final 
and at least 5 fully realized playable levels.
